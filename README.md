# Chess

Chess program created using Python version 3.6.1 and pygame version 1.9.3. 

At present it only has the piece movement and a turn system. It still needs to be able to give check/checkmate, identify illegal moves, castle and enpassant capture. I will try to add these features in a later update however feel free to put forward suggestions
